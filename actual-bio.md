# Hi, I'm Frederico Moreira (a.k.a. Hypervanse) 👋

**Academic name:** F. C. Moreira  
**Profession:** Mathematical Physicist (PhD, Solitons, advised by V. V. Konotop)  
**Specialist in:** Problem solving, algorithm invention, and seeing with fresh eyes

## 👨‍🔬 About Me

- **Inventor by necessity:** My research in mathematical physics (solitons) required inventing novel algorithms and methods, not just using existing tools.
- **Toolbox:** Heavy LATEX and MATLAB user, but my real skill lies in creating what doesn't exist yet.
- **Hardware explorer:** Deep hands-on experience with QEMU, KVM, and ethical hacking (yes, I break my own stuff—because that's how you truly understand it).
- **AI and Systems:** Since 2023, alternating between probing OpenAI (ChatGPT), Kubernetes, and the intersection of robust systems and AI. Fascinated by the models, wary of the industry’s shortcuts.
- **Alignment thinker:** Alignment isn’t just a buzzword—it's a hard, real problem, and I have my own solution (ask me about it ⚛️).
- **Fresh perspective:** I believe real progress comes from independent, critical thinking—think Feynman with the Challenger, not Silicon Valley herd mentality.

## 🧰 Skills & Interests

- **Mathematical Physics:** Solitons, analytical & numerical methods, algorithm design
- **Programming:** MATLAB, LaTeX, Python, shell scripting, C (for hardware interfacing)
- **Systems:** QEMU, KVM, virtualization, low-level debugging, hardware-software integration
- **AI/ML:** Probing LLMs, AI alignment, practical evaluation of model robustness
- **Ethical Hacking:** Security through curiosity—break, learn, fix, repeat
- **Philosophy of Science:** Critical thinking, outsider perspectives, “fresh eyes” problem-solving

## 🧪 Projects & Highlights

- **PhD Thesis:** Solitons (advisor: V. V. Konotop)
- **Algorithm Inventor:** Developed custom algorithms where none existed for my research
- **System Security:** Regularly stress-test my own systems, both for fun and for science
- **OpenAI & Kubernetes:** Ongoing probes and explorations—ask for details
- **Alignment Solution:** Alignment isn’t one-size-fits-all; I built my own approach (⚛️)
